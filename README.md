## Introduction

Media distribution has transitioned from a product in physical space to a commodity in digital space.  Markets, copyright law and ownership of the media had clear and well defined boundaries with physical products (CD, DVD, etc) as a distribution medium.  However, in the digital domain, sharing in an inherent attribute of the digital product, the media file.

This of course has caused much disruption for the music and film industries.  These industries were established by selling ownership to physical products.

Yet, grasping at a paradigm that supports products in a physical space will limit the opportunities of whatâ€™s possible with emerging and unstoppable technologies such as BitTorrent and Bitcoins.

What is needed is a built-in mechanism to compensate digital content creators directly for usage of their content rather than selling ownership of a product.  With a payment mechanism built in, content creators can encourage sharing of the media while expecting direct payment from from the consumer.

## Virtual Property

Virtual property are digital objects, or media files, that are not controlled by a central authority, can be exchanged between peers and yet can only have a single owner for direct royalties and payments.

## Playcoins

A new unit of currency is introduced to enable specific operations. Playcoins are earned by these operations:

- *Mining*: Confirming blocks of transactions (a la Bitcoin)
- *Storage*: By hosting media files, miners earn a "download fee".
- *Streaming*: By serving streams to listeners., miners earn a "streaming fee".

## Content Creator

**Content Creators** are entities who wish to release a digital media file into the Playcoin ecosystem.  

Content Creators set the Playcoin purchase price, and an optional streaming price, as well as the fees paid to the **Storage Hosts** for hosting, signing and streaming the media file .

## Mining

Mining is the process of spending computation power to secure Playcoin transactions against reversal and introducing new Playcoins to the system.

See [Bitcoin Mining](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/FAQ#Mining)

## Storage

Playcoins can be used to purchase a copy of a media file from any **Storage Host** who has previously purchased the file.  

The purchase price is set/updated by the content creator and includes a small **storage fee** which is kept by the storage host.

[DRAFT] When a media file is purchased from a storage host, the file must be encrypted with the purchasing host's public key and include a hash of the storage host's key showing the chain of purchases originating back to the original content creator.

Media file integrity is validated by the hash of the original content creators signature.

## Streaming

[DRAFT]  Storage hosts may also earn play coins by **Streaming**  a media file.  Streaming royalties and streaming fees must be defined

## Consumers

Consumers who wish to listen/watch a media may pay the Playcoin price to obtain a copy or pay a smaller price to stream.

Consumers who have a catalog of media automatically become storage hosts who can earn Playcoins for storage or streaming.

For immediate use, consumers may purchase Playcoins on open digital exchanges.  Or, consumers may choose to earn Playcoins by mining them over time.



## Economics 

- *Playcoins are limited and distributed over time* at the inverse of computing power.  Playcoin price discovery happens through open exchanges (Playcoin/Bitcoin, Playcoin/USD, etc)

- *Playcoins are rewarded to miners* for submitting proof of work.

- *Content creators provide media content* with a purchase price set in play coins.

- *Content Creators exchange their Playcoins for other currencies* through open exchanges; compensated for their work.

- *To earn Playcoin storage fees, Storage Hosts store purchased copies* of media file  There is incentive to purchase and store popular content, thus leading to an incentive to promote the catalog.
