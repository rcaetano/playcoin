## Enabling a P2P exchange for digital content distribution and payments


## Introduction

Media distribution has transitioned from a product in physical space to a commodity in digital space.  Markets, copyright law and ownership of the media has clear and well defined boundaries with physical products.  However, in the digital domain, sharing in an inherent attribute of the product, a file.

This of course has caused much disruption for music and film industries.  These industries were established by selling ownership to physical products which distributed the original content.

Yet grasping at a paradigm built for products in a physical space will limit the opportunities of whatâ€™s possible with emerging and unstoppable technologies such as BitTorrent and Bitcoins.

What is needed is a built-in mechanism to compensate digital content creators directly for usage of their content rather than selling ownership of a product.  With a payment mechanism built in, content creators can encourage sharing of the media while expecting direct payment from from the consumer.
