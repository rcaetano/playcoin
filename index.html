<a name="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>Media distribution has transitioned from a product in physical space to a commodity in digital space.  Markets, copyright law and ownership of the media had clear and well defined boundaries with physical products (CD, DVD, etc) as a distribution medium.  However, in the digital domain, sharing in an inherent attribute of the digital product, the media file.</p>

<p>This of course has caused much disruption for the music and film industries.  These industries were established by selling ownership to physical products.</p>

<p>Yet, grasping at a paradigm that supports products in a physical space will limit the opportunities of whatâ€™s possible with emerging and unstoppable technologies such as BitTorrent and Bitcoins.</p>

<p>What is needed is a built-in mechanism to compensate digital content creators directly for usage of their content rather than selling ownership of a product.  With a payment mechanism built in, content creators can encourage sharing of the media while expecting direct payment from from the consumer.</p>

<a name="virtual-property" class="anchor" href="#virtual-property"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Virtual Property</h2>

<p>Virtual property are digital objects, or media files, that are not controlled by a central authority, can be exchanged between peers and yet can only have a single owner for direct royalties and payments.</p>

<a name="playcoins" class="anchor" href="#playcoins"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Playcoins</h2>

<p>A new unit of currency is introduced to enable specific operations. Playcoins are earned by these operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Mining</em>: Confirming blocks of transactions (a la Bitcoin)</li>
<li>
<em>Storage</em>: By hosting media files, miners earn a "download fee".</li>
<li>
<em>Streaming</em>: By serving streams to listeners., miners earn a "streaming fee".</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="content-creator" class="anchor" href="#content-creator"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Content Creator</h2>

<p><strong>Content Creators</strong> are entities who wish to release a digital media file into the Playcoin ecosystem.  </p>

<p>Content Creators set the Playcoin purchase price, and an optional streaming price, as well as the fees paid to the <strong>Storage Hosts</strong> for hosting, signing and streaming the media file.</p>

<h2>
<a name="media-hosts" class="anchor" href="#media-hosts"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Media Hosts</h2>

<p>Content on the network are distrubuted via <strong>Media Hosts</strong>.  Media hosts connect to the P2P and can do the following:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Connect and interact with other hosts on the Playcoin network</li>
<li>Earn Playcoins by mining (confirming transactions on the network)</li>
<li>Purchase media from content creators stored by other hosts</li>
<li>Earn storage fee for storing content purchased by other hosts</li>
<li>Earn fees for streaming content</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="mining" class="anchor" href="#mining"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mining</h2>

<p>Mining is the process of spending computation power to secure Playcoin transactions against reversal and introducing new Playcoins to the system.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/FAQ#Mining">Bitcoin Mining</a></p>

<h2>
<a name="storage" class="anchor" href="#storage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Storage</h2>

<p>Playcoins can be used to purchase a copy of a media file from any <strong>Storage Host</strong> who has previously purchased the file.  </p>

<p>The purchase price is set/updated by the content creator and includes a small <strong>storage fee</strong> which is kept by the storage host.</p>

<p>[DRAFT] When a media file is purchased from a storage host, the file must be encrypted with the purchasing host's public key and include a hash of the storage host's key showing the chain of purchases originating back to the original content creator.</p>

<p>Media file integrity is validated by the hash of the original content creators signature.</p>

<h2>
<a name="streaming" class="anchor" href="#streaming"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Streaming</h2>

<p>[DRAFT]  Storage hosts may also earn play coins by <strong>Streaming</strong>  a media file.  Streaming royalties and streaming fees must be defined</p>

<h2>
<a name="consumers" class="anchor" href="#consumers"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Consumers</h2>

<p>Consumers who wish to listen/watch a media may pay the Playcoin price to obtain a copy or pay a smaller price to stream.</p>

<p>Consumers who have a catalog of media automatically become storage hosts who can earn Playcoins for storage or streaming.</p>

<p>For immediate use, consumers may purchase Playcoins on open digital exchanges.  Or, consumers may choose to earn Playcoins by mining them over time.</p>

<h2>
<a name="economics" class="anchor" href="#economics"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Economics</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Playcoins are limited and distributed over time</em> at the inverse of computing power.  Playcoin price discovery happens through open exchanges (Playcoin/Bitcoin, Playcoin/USD, etc)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Playcoins are rewarded to miners</em> for submitting proof of work.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Content creators provide media content</em> with a purchase price set in play coins.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Content Creators exchange their Playcoins for other currencies</em> through open exchanges; compensated for their work.</p></li>
<li><p><em>To earn Playcoin storage fees, Storage Hosts store purchased copies</em> of media file  There is incentive to purchase and store popular content, thus leading to an incentive to promote the catalog.</p></li>
